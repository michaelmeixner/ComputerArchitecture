Steps for an execute process:
    1. Fetch
        - from program pointer
    2. Decode
    3. Execute
        - ALU
            - (ALU also sets flags)
    4. Save in memory 
        - register
    5. Write back

Clock cycle:
    - how fast the clock oscillates
    - can be shown by a square wave
    - a single clock cycle completes an execute process
    - the "clock" is a piece of quarts which governs the speed of oscillations in the CPU (CPU "refresh" rate)
        - a register can be read from or written to
        - the clock cycle specifies which one is happening
        - registers can only be written to on the up-tick of the clock cycle (first vertical line of square wave, read for horizontal, vertical, horizontal lines in that order)
