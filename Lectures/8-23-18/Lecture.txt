Basics of C:
    Old language, so very stable
    
    #include does the same as import in java, but it makes the preprocessor copy the whole package into your source code.

    when compiling a .c file:
    >compile
        >compiler starts preprocessor
            >preprocessor runs through code and makes it a .i file
    .i file gets run through by compiler<
        >a .o (object) file comes out of compiler (an object file is a set of machine instructions but it isn't an executable file) (like having all the parts of somethings but not having the usable thing itself)
    the linker takes the object files and links them together to produce an executable<

    when writing in C, you have to write two files for every file you want:
        a .c file
        a .h (header) file - which is a text file of your source code that doesn't get compiled - used for sharing along with the .o file
            kind of like a table of contents for the compiler; compiler uses .h, linker uses .o
