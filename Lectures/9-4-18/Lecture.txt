editor stuff:
    c uses a single-pass compiler, so methods (functions) can't be called unless they're seen above the function that's calling them (i.e. function prototypes).

    .h files are header files and you can put the prototypes of functions in there because the preprocessor reads that file first.

    #include "fileName.h" in your fileName.c file

    preprocessor is a scriptable text editor

pointers:
    "heap":
        designated/reserved memory for your program during compile-time
    dynamic memory allocation:
        within heap, memory that changes based on what parts of the program need which amounts of memory
    pointer/address/reference operator:
        allocated chunk of memory for parts of program
        we assign a pointer variable to the chunk of storage; 
        example:
            int *ptr; (datatype "int" necessary)
            ptr = 4;
