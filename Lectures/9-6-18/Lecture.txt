malloc and calloc: functions that allow you to specify how much RAM you  want to use
    malloc:
        void * malloc(amount_of_RAM);

        char * array = NULL;
        array = (char*) malloc(100); //gives you 100 bytes of RAM because the size of char is 1
        alsoArray = (int *) malloc(100 * sizeOf(int)); //multiplies 100 by size of int to give you that many bytes
    
        malloc gives you "dirty" RAM

    calloc:
        clears the RAM before it gives it back to you so it's all zeros

Leak:
    calloc(num elements, size of element);

    int *alsoArray;
    char * array = NULL;

    array = (char *) malloc(100);

    free(array); //free funtion clears something from RAM; this particular example is tricky because array is a pointer
    array = NULL;
